/**
 * The pool of phrasings Meowmeow can pick from for each kind of message, plus
 * the picking logic itself. Kept apart from {@link Ui} so the wording (which
 * changes often and should stay skimmable) doesn't clutter the class that
 * decides <em>when</em> each message is shown.
 *
 * <p>Every category below has several phrasings; {@link Ui} asks for one by
 * category and supplies the {@link Random}, so the choice can be seeded. The
 * console entry point uses a fixed seed so its output stays byte-for-byte
 * reproducible for {@code test/ui-test-plan.md}; the GUI seeds with a real
 * random source instead.
