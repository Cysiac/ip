 * line - see {@link Task#toFileString()} for the exact format.
 *
 * <p>The path is always <em>relative</em> to the working directory (never
 * something machine-specific like {@code C:\data}) and is built from
 * separate name segments via {@link Path#of(String, String...)}, so the
 * same code locates the file correctly on Windows, macOS and Linux.
 *
 * <p>First-run friendly: {@link #load()} treats a missing file or missing
 * folder as "no tasks yet" rather than an error, and {@link #save(List)}
 * creates the folder before writing.
 *
 * <p>Problems that are not fatal to the session - an unreadable line, or a
 * failed save - are reported to the user through {@link Ui} rather than
 * thrown, so one bad line never loses the rest of the list.
